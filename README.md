# Udacity Version Control Project (README.md)
> This **pdsnd_github** REPOSITORY is created for the purpose of the Udacity Version Control course Project.

# Project Objective
The project objective is to demonstrate the following course related aspects of:
1. Create a local repository:
fork and copy locally _bikeshare.py_ (=fork), and create _.gitignore_ (to exclude data files from version control tracking). This is to avoid sharing data publicly.
2. Copy the created repository on github.
3. Create a **"documentation"** _branch_. Work on doc using README file. And pushback changes on github.
4. Create a **"refactoring"** _branch_. To improve\refactor the code (readability aspect).
5. Merge a and b on the master branch. pdf git command documentation ([merge-url]).
6. Upload the merged branch to github.
7. Submit the template based all commands used for the project ([init-template]).
8. Acquire "Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide" capabilities to commit with type/subject; body, and footer.

## Repository content
* This REPOSITORY contains one python code, and its related DATA files.
* This REPOSITORY also contains this README.md and a .gitignore file.

### Project python code & Data installation and Execution
The python code in use in this Project is **_bikeshare.py_** and this REPOSITORY has 3 data files for 3 Cities (Chicago, NYC, and Washingtown). For the **_bikeshare.py_** code execution, the cities .csv data files must be located in the folder **_bikeshare.py_** is located too.
